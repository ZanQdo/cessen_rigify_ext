# Cessen's Rigify Extensions

This is a collection of custom rig types and metarigs that can be used with Rigify in Blender 2.8x and higher.

Special thanks to [angavrilov](https://github.com/angavrilov) for the initial port of these rig types to the new Rigify system.

## Support

For the time being, I am only maintaining these rigs for my own personal use.  If you happen to find them useful, that's great!  Feel free to use them.  But do keep in mind that I don't plan to support them, maintain backwards compatability, etc.  So if you choose to use them in a critical setting (e.g. a production environment), you should probably also plan to maintain a fork of your own.
